## Project 1: Alien invasion
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
## Project 2: Data visualization
This section of the repository focuses on the Data Visualization project from Python Crash Course, which explores the art of turning raw, complex datasets into meaningful visual narratives. Using industry-standard libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly, the project transitions from generating internal data—such as simulating mathematical Random Walks and dice-roll probabilities—to processing real-world CSV and JSON files to map global weather trends and seismic activity. The workflow concludes with a deep dive into APIs, where live data is fetched from GitHub to create interactive, clickable visualizations of the world’s most-starred Python repositories. This project demonstrates a full mastery of data cleaning, technical documentation literacy, and the creation of presentation-ready, interactive graphics.
## Project 3: Web applications
